# Cotton Disease Prediction




### Problem Statement

Detect if a cotton plant and leaf have disease based on its image.


### Model

I have used the transfer learning technique to complete the task.

1. I have used a pre-trained VGG-19 model.
2. A Flatten layer was added to and the output is fed to a Dense layer having 4 units for classification and "softmax" activation function.


### Training

The model has been trained for 7 epochs. 

For training, the loss started from 1.3 and ended at 0.18. The accuracy started from 61% and ended in 94%.

For validation, the loss started from 0.42 and ended at 0.19. The accuracy started from 80% and ended in 93%
